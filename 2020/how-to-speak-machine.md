# How to Speak Machine: Computational Thinking for the Rest of Us — By John Maeda

## Introduction

> I honestly don't believe that design is the most important matter today. Instead, I believe we should focus first on understanding *computation*. Because when we combine design with computation, a kind of magic results; when we combine business with computation, great financial opportunities can emerge. (xi)

Computation is ...
- An invisible, aliens universe that is infinitely large and infinitesimally detailed
- A kind of raw material that doesn't obey the laws of physics, and it's what powers the internet at a level that far transcends the power of electricity
- A ubiquitous medium that experienced software developers and the tech industry control to a degree that threatens the sovereignty of existing nation-states
- Not something you can fully grasp after training in a "learn to code" boot camp, where mechanics of programming can be easily learned < More like a foreign country with its own culture, its own set of problems, and its own language — but where knowing the language is not enough, let alone if you have only a minimal understanding of it

Computation + design = The latter makes the former relevant to business and, more so, to our everyday lives. Even more so, "design matters a lot when it is leveraged with a deep understanding of computation and the unique set of possibilities it brings." (xiii)

*How to Speak Machine* is a result of a six-year journey of Maeda from "pure" design to into the heart of what is impacting design the most: computation.  

## Machines run Loops

1. **Computer excel at repeating themselves through loops**
	- Does repetition better: A computer > A man, animal, or machine in the real world
	- Personal story: Maeda shared his experience of reducing 14,600 lines of code (a program a monthly billing) to less than 50 lines of code (using Loops instead), which deflated his ego because he had taken pride in his ability to get work done by sheer brute force—manually. But he realized that work could be done elegantly if he had think in LOOPS (the way a computer natively thinks). Takeaway: "Making the computer do the same thing over and over seems like we're taking advantage of its lack of intelligence. But we must exercise a great deal of our own intelligence to turn repetition into a form of art in code." (11)
2. **Hard machines are visible; soft machine are invisible**
	- "Is software visible? Yes and no. On the one hand, program code is what lies at the heart of software and you can read it, but that's like confusing the recipe for cake with the cake itself. *The software is what comes alive inside the machine* [emphasis mine] due to the program codes — it's the cake, not the recipe." (13)
	- William Gibson's trippy description on *Cyberspace* (counted by Gibson in *Neuromancer* in 1984): "Cyberspace, a consensual hallucination, experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts ... Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights receding ..." (13-14)
	- To speak machine, you need to "live" in the world (invisible by nature) of the machine too (15). To make the "invisible" more understandable, Maeda leads next with when there are/were fully visible machinery of computation — human beings (also notes about many professional women who were unfairly made invisible)
3. **Human computers are the original computing machines**
	- The definition of computer throughout history: 1613 = Richard Braithwaite described "the best arithmetician that ever breathed" as "the truest computer of times" => 1895 *Century dictionary* = "One who computes; a reckoned; a calculator; specifically, one whose occupation is to make arithmetical calculations for mathematicians, astronomers, geodesists, etc." => 1900-50s = A person who worked with pencil and paper, e.g. Works Progress Administration started the Mathematical Tables Project, employing hundreds of unskilled Americans to hand-tabulate a variety of mathematical functions over a ten-year period [Note: Reminds me of *Three-Body Problem*'s simulation of soldiers computing / acting as bits (holding a flag up as 1 or down as 0); creating logics, killed by their king when malfunctioned] => Dr. Alan Turing and the Turing machine; human computers were comparatively slow, at times inconsistent and make mistakes that a digital computer would never make; The machine would be fed a state of conditions that would determine where the umbers on the tape would be written or rewritten based on what it could read—and in doing so calculations could be performed, which Turing envisioned a machine could tirelessly calculate => Built for the US Army, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer); first working computing machine to implement Turing's ideas. => Late 1950s = Dr. Grace Hopper invented the first "human readable" computer language, which made it easier for people to speak machine => 1960s = The craft of writing these programmed instructions was first referred to as "software engineering" by NASA scientist Margaret Hamilton
	- "Computation is made by us, and we are now collectively responsible for its outcomes." (20)
4. **Recursion is the most elegant means to repeat oneself**
	- "Recursion" as a concept is an idea that you don't naturally come across in your daily life, because it doesn't fit how the physical world around us usually works. (21)
	- Writing recursion into programs = As simple as defining an idea as directly related to the idea itself. Tree with a lot of subbranches created by simply using the same method you started with ... a tree branch is composed of tree branches (the part is defined but he part itself). Same as its root system—so nature paints with recursion quietly and obviously. (23)
	- Russian matryoshka doll is a close physical metaphor — a doll that has a smaller but identical version of itself nested inside it, and on and on.
	- "The central idea [of recursion] is to express the definition of something with a definition itself, which is a vaguely imaginable idea that doesn't have a home in the real world but is completely native in the palm of cyberspace." (25)
	- LOL: "**Recursion** (*noun)*. If you still don't get it, see **recursion**." - Michael Corballis
5. **Loops are indestructible unless a programmer has made an error**
	- "Be prepared, however, for a future where computers can reach inside themselves to relentlessly remove the bugs we put inside them—removing any and all obstacles to make their powerful looping activities interminable. *Repeating themselves unerringly, forever.*" (31)

## Machines get Large
1. **Embracing exponential thinking is unnatural at first**
2. **Loops wrapped inside loops open new dimensions**
3. **Be open to both directions of the powers of ten**
4. **Losing touch with human scale can make you toxic**
5. **Computers team up with each other way better than we do**
