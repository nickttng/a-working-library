# How to Speak Machine: Computational Thinking for the Rest of Us — By John Maeda

## Introduction

> I honestly don't believe that design is the most important matter today. Instead, I believe we should focus first on understanding *computation*. Because when we combine design with computation, a kind of magic results; when we combine business with computation, great financial opportunities can emerge. (xi)

Computation is ...
- An invisible, aliens universe that is infinitely large and infinitesimally detailed
- A kind of raw material that doesn't obey the laws of physics, and it's what powers the internet at a level that far transcends the power of electricity
- A ubiquitous medium that experienced software developers and the tech industry control to a degree that threatens the sovereignty of existing nation-states
- Not something you can fully grasp after training in a "learn to code" boot camp, where mechanics of programming can be easily learned < More like a foreign country with its own culture, its own set of problems, and its own language — but where knowing the language is not enough, let alone if you have only a minimal understanding of it

Computation + design = The latter makes the former relevant to business and, more so, to our everyday lives. Even more so, "design matters a lot when it is leveraged with a deep understanding of computation and the unique set of possibilities it brings." (xiii)

*How to Speak Machine* is a result of a six-year journey of Maeda from "pure" design to into the heart of what is impacting design the most: computation.
