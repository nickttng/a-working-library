# How to Speak Machine: Computational Thinking for the Rest of Us — By John Maeda

## Introduction

> I honestly don't believe that design is the most important matter today. Instead, I believe we should focus first on understanding *computation*. Because when we combine design with computation, a kind of magic results; when we combine business with computation, great financial opportunities can emerge. (xi)

Computation is ...
- An invisible, aliens universe that is infinitely large and infinitesimally detailed
- A kind of raw material that doesn't obey the laws of physics, and it's what powers the internet at a level that far transcends the power of electricity
- A ubiquitous medium that experienced software developers and the tech industry control to a degree that threatens the sovereignty of existing nation-states
- Not something you can fully grasp after training in a "learn to code" boot camp, where mechanics of programming can be easily learned < More like a foreign country with its own culture, its own set of problems, and its own language — but where knowing the language is not enough, let alone if you have only a minimal understanding of it

Computation + design = The latter makes the former relevant to business and, more so, to our everyday lives. Even more so, "design matters a lot when it is leveraged with a deep understanding of computation and the unique set of possibilities it brings." (xiii)

*How to Speak Machine* is a result of a six-year journey of Maeda from "pure" design to into the heart of what is impacting design the most: computation.  

## Machines run Loops

1. **Computer excel at repeating themselves through loops**
	- Does repetition better: A computer > A man, animal, or machine in the real world
	- Personal story: Maeda shared his experience of reducing 14,600 lines of code (a program a monthly billing) to less than 50 lines of code (using Loops instead), which deflated his ego because he had taken pride in his ability to get work done by sheer brute force—manually. But he realized that work could be done elegantly if he had think in LOOPS (the way a computer natively thinks). Takeaway: "Making the computer do the same thing over and over seems like we're taking advantage of its lack of intelligence. But we must exercise a great deal of our own intelligence to turn repetition into a form of art in code." (11)
2. **Hard machines are visible; soft machine are invisible**
	- "Is software visible? Yes and no. On the one hand, program code is what lies at the heart of software and you can read it, but that's like confusing the recipe for cake with the cake itself. *The software is what comes alive inside the machine* [emphasis mine] due to the program codes — it's the cake, not the recipe." (13)
	- William Gibson's trippy description on *Cyberspace* (counted by Gibson in *Neuromancer* in 1984): "Cyberspace, a consensual hallucination, experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts ... Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights receding ..." (13-14)
	- To speak machine, you need to "live" the world (invisible by nature) of the machine too (15). To make the "invisible" more understandable, Maeda leads next with when there are/were fully visible machinery of computation — human beings (also notes about many professional women who were unfairly made invisible)
3. Human computers are the original computing machines
4. Recursion is the most elegant means to repeat oneself
5. Loops are indestructible unless a programmer has made an error
