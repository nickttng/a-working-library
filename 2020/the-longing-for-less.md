# The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism — Kyle Chayka

## Reduction

On minimalism being more trendy than practical

> On one hand there was the facade of minimalism: its brand and visual appearance. On the other was the unhappiness at the root of it all, caused by a society that tells you more is always better. Every advertisement for a new product implied that you should dislike what you already had. It took Andersen a long time to understand the lesson: "There was really nothing wrong with our lives at all." (8)

On material accumulation as a form of security (from the 20th century mindset) that is not true anymore

> ... the greatest wealth now comes from the accumulation of invisible capital, not physical stuff: startup- equity, stock shares, and offshore bank accounts opened to avoid taxes. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out, these immaterial possessions grow in value much faster than salaries do. That is, if you're lucky enough to have a salary in the first place. Crisis flooding crisis; flexibility and mobility now feel safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive. (10-11)

On the author's purpose of writing *The Longing for Less*

> ... to figure out the origins of the thought that less could be better than more—in possessions, in aesthetics, in sensory perception, and in the philosophy with which we approach our lives ... to uncover a minimalism of ideas rather than things, not obsess over possessions or the lack thereof but challenge our day-to-day experience of being in the world (13-14)

On why it is difficult to make sense of minimalism

> Minimalism's lack of a coherent history is in part due to its nature—it instinctively tends to erase its own background, as if starting a new in each iteration. (15)

^ However, Chayka observes the common qualities between these ideas: 1) reduction; 2) emptiness; 3) silence; and 4) shadow (15)
