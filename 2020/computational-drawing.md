# Computational Drawing: From foundational exercises to theories of representation

## Acknowledgments 

At RISD, the book was fleshed out under students in these courses: *Computing Drawing: Animating the Thick Surface*, *Computing Drawing: Inhabiting Surface*, *Computing Drawing: Similarly Different Lines*, and *Architecture Based on Drawing Buildings*

## Preface

> Computing and drawing have intertwined histories. The first computer art was drawn. Limits on processing power and memory storage precluded pixels and images. Instead, computers were programmed to control machines that moved pens to make marks on paper. Soon thereafter, the trajectories of computing and drawing diverged. **The aim of this book, and the work within it, is to explore the implications of bringing them back together.** (10)

> I think everyone should code, at least a little, and I *know* everyone can do it. However, the best way to learn in any creative field, no matter what type of learner one is, involves a messy integration with an existing creative practice. (11)

In the preface, Lostritto begins with an exercise to fuel an internal discourse:

- List all the reasons you draw
- List all the reasons you write code
- What items are on one list and not the other?
- How would drawing/coding in your practice be different if their roles were more similar?
